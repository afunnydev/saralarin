  description: "The idea of agile copywriting comes from my work in Montreal-based advertising agencies. A market analysis and several\_successfully\_completed projects confirmed the need for a copywriting service with an added value\_that combines strategy, creativity, and management. <br><br> When needed, I work with collaborators specialized in graphic design, website production, SEO, and more. <br><br> Therefore, I can offer a complete copywriting solution that meets your needs."
